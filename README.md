# European-football-analysis
Basic analysis of European football data  using pandas scikit and matplotlib.
Mutlivariable regression was  used.
The purpose of this project was to find the Average player rating with the given features like skills , preferred foot, power accuracy
etc.
Github did not let me upload such a large database fiile so i trimmed it down into a csv file. which might alter the results at the end but the model should work perfectly fine.
