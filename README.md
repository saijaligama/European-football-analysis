# European-football-analysis
Basic analysis of European football data  using pandas scikit and matplotlib.
Linear regression and DecisionTreeRegressor were the two algorithms used.
The purpose of this project was to find the Average player rating with the given features like skills , preferred foot, power accuracy
etc.
Github did not let me upload such a large database fiile so i trimmed it down into a csv file. which might alter the results at the end but the model should work perfectly fine.
Linear regressor generated an RMSE score of 2.8 and 
DecisionTreeRegressor got an RMSE score of 1.4
the DecisionTreeRegressor was  a mch better model for this particular dataset
